  pull_request:
    branches directory that already exists and is not empty.

To resolve this issue, you should update your workflow to ensure that the directory is cleaned up before cloning the repository. Here is an updated version of your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: [ "main" ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Remove existing directory
